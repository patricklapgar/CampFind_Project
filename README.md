# YelpCamp

# Overview
YelpCamp is a full-stack web application based off of the final student project of Colt Steele's 'The Complete Web Developer Bootcamp' where the user can create, read, update, and delete 'campgrounds'.
A user is also allowed to include a campground's location, daily listing price as well as post a comment in the section below a campground's picture. 

# Flow
1. The user views the Node.js web app in the browser
2. All components, written in Node.js, communicate with the Express back-end and performs CRUD operations to display and manage data.
3. The back-end Node.JS/Epxress application uses the Mongo database for storing and retrieving data.
4. Back-end results are communicated back to the front end.
5. Front-end results are then rendered and displayed in a readable format using the ejs templating engine.

# Front-End
Uses embedded Javascript (ejs) templating format as well as Bootstrap v3.3.5 framerwork to display front-end functionality.
The application heavily uses forms and lists to take user input.

# Back-End
Uses Node.js to connect various files into routes and construct different routes using the CRUD development method.
The database used to store data is MongoDB and multiple Schemas were created for purposes of building and manipulating different objects critical to make the application work.
