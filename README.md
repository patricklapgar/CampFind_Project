# Camp_Find_Project

# Overview
CampFind is a full-stack web application based off of the final student project of Colt Steele's 'The Complete Web Developer Bootcamp' where the user can create, read, update, and delete 'campgrounds'.
A user is also allowed to include a campground's location, daily listing price as well as post a comment in the section below a campground's picture. 

# Front-End
Uses embedded Javascript (ejs) templating format as well as Bootstrap v3.3.5 framerwork to display front-end functionality.
The application heavily uses forms and lists to take user input.

# Back-End
Uses the NodeJS framework to connect various files into routes and construct different routes using the CRUD development method.
The database used to store data is MongoDB and multiple Schemas were created for purposes of building and manipulating different objects critical to make the application work.
